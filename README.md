# Boom-sprayer-constant-presssure-Flow-control-using-
It was a funded project to sprayer on agriculture field. The purpose of this project was to spray only on the weeds according to the size of weed. Thus we developed a system to control flow rate of the nozzles. This control determines the spray on the weed. if the size of weeds are small so less flow rate is allowed through nozzles and vice versa

PID_flow_control.ino is the main Arduino file for controlling sprayer flow control. in this
part the device is kept at a constant fluid flow stage to spray at the plants.
